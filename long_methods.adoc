Mechanics, from _Refactorings_ by J. Fields et al.

. Create a new method, and name it after the intention of the method.
. Copy the extracted code from the source method into the new target method.
. Scan the extracted code for references to any variables that are local in
scope to the source method. These are local variables and parameters to the
method.
. See whether any temporary variables are used only within this extracted code.
If so, declare them in the target method as temporary variables.
. Look to see whether any of these local-scope variables are modified by the
extracted code. If one variable is modified, see whether you can treat the
extracted code as a query and assign the result to the variable con- cerned.
You may need to use Split Tempo- rary Variable and try again. You can eliminate
temporary variables with Replace Temp with Query.
. Pass into the target method as parameters local-scope variables that are read
from the extracted code.
. Replace the extracted code in the source method with a call to the target method.

## Example 1

```ruby
def print_owing(amount)
  print_banner
  puts "name: #{@name}"
  puts "amount: #{amount}"
end
```
