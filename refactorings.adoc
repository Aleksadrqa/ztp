## Composing Methods

Extract Method::
  You have a code fragment that can be grouped together. +
  _Turn the fragment into a method whose name explains the purpose of the method._
Inline Method::
  A method's body is just as clear as its name. +
  _Put the method's body into the body of its callers and remove the method._
Inline Temp::
  You have a temp that is assigned to once with a simple expression, and the temp is getting in the way of other refactorings.
  _Replace all references to that temp with the expression._
Replace Temp with Query::
  You are using a temporary variable to hold the result of an expression.
  _Extract the expression into a method. Replace all references to the temp with the expression. The new method can then be used in other methods._
