## Composing Methods

Extract Method::
  You have a code fragment that can be grouped together. +
  _Turn the fragment into a method whose name explains the purpose of the method._
Inline Method::
  A method's body is just as clear as its name. +
  _Put the method's body into the body of its callers and remove the method._
Inline Temp::
  You have a temp that is assigned to once with a simple expression, and the temp is getting in the way of other refactorings.
  _Replace all references to that temp with the expression._
Replace Temp with Query::
  You are using a temporary variable to hold the result of an expression. +
  _Extract the expression into a method. Replace all references to the temp with the expression. The new method can then be used in other methods._
Replace Temp with Chain::
  You are using a temporary variable to hold the result of an expression. +
  _Change the methods to support chaining, thus removing the need for a temp._
Introduce Explaining Variable::
  You have a complicated expression. +
  _Put the result of the expression, or parts of the expression, in a temporary vari- able with a name that explains the purpose._
Split Temporary Variable::
  You have a temporary variable assigned to more than once, but it is not a loop variable nor a collecting temporary variable. +
  _Make a separate temporary variable for each assignment._
Remove Assignments to Parameters::
  The code assigns to a parameter. +
  Use a temporary variable instead.
Replace Method with Method Object::
  You have a long method that uses local variables in such a way that you cannot apply Extract Method. +
  _Turn the method into its own object so that all the local variables become instance variables on that object. You can then decompose the method into other methods on the same object._
Substitute Algorithm::
  You want to replace an algorithm with one that is clearer. +
  _Replace the body of the method with the new algorithm._
Replace Loop with Collection Closure Method::
  You are processing the elements of a collection in a loop. +
  _Replace the loop with a collection closure method._
Extract Surrounding Method::
  You have two methods that contain nearly identical code. The variance is in the middle of the method. +
  _Extract the duplication into a method that accepts a block and yields back to the caller to execute the unique code._
Introduce Class Annotation::
  You have a method whose implementation steps are so common that they can safely be hidden away. +
  _Declare the behavior by calling a class method from the class definition._
Introduce Named Parameter::
  The parameters in a method call cannot easily be deduced from the name of the method you are calling. +
  _Convert the parameter list into a Hash, and use the keys of the Hash as names for the parameters._
Remove Named Parameter::
  The fluency that the named parameter brings is no longer worth the complexity on the receiver. +
  _Convert the named parameter Hash to a standard parameter list._
Remove Unused Default Parameter::
  A parameter has a default value, but the method is never called without the parameter. +
  _Remove the default value._
Dynamic Method Definition::
  You have methods that can be defined more concisely if defined dynamically. +
  _Define the methods dynamically._
Replace Dynamic Receptor with Dynamic Method Definition::
  You have methods you want to handle dynamically without the pain of debug- ging method_missing. +
  _Use dynamic method definition to define the necessary methods._
Isolate Dynamic Receptor::
  A class utilizing method_missing has become painful to alter.
  _Introduce a new class and move the method_missing logic to that class._
Move Eval from Runtime to Parse Time::
  You need to use eval but want to limit the number of times eval is necessary. +
  _Move the use of eval from within the method definition to defining the method itself._


## Moving Features Between Objects

Move Method::
  A method is, or will be, using or used by more features of another class than the class on which it is defined. +
  _Create a new method with a similar body in the class it uses most. Either turn the old method into a simple delegation, or remove it altogether._
Move Field::
  A field is, or will be, used by another class more than the class on which it is defined. +
  _Create a new attribute reader (and if necessary, a writer) in the target class, and change all its users._
Extract Class::
  You have one class doing work that should be done by two. +
  _Create a new class and move the relevant fields and methods from the old class into the new class._
Inline Class::
  A class isn’t doing very much. +
  _Move all its features into another class and delete it._
Hide Delegate::
  A client is calling a delegate class of an object. +
  _Create methods on the server to hide the delegate._
Remove Middle Man::
  A class is doing too much simple delegation. +
  _Get the client to call the delegate directly._


## Organizing Data

Self Encapsulate Field::
  You are accessing a field directly, but the coupling to the field is becoming awkward. +
  _Create getting and setting methods for the field and use only those to access the field._
Replace Data Value with Object::
  You have a data item that needs additional data or behavior. +
  _Turn the data item into an object._
Change Reference to Value::
  You have a reference object that is small, immutable, and awkward to manage. +
  _Turn it into a value object._
Replace Array with Object::
  You have an Array in which certain elements mean different things. +
  _Replace the Array with an object that has a field for each element._
Replace Hash with Object::
  You have a Hash that stores several different types of objects, and is passed around and used for more than one purpose. +
  _Replace the Hash with an object that has a field for each key._
Change Unidirectional Association to Bidirectional::
  You have two classes that need to use each other’s features, but there is only a one-way link. +
  _Add back pointers, and change modifiers to update both sets._
Change Bidirectional Association to Unidirectional::
  You have a two-way association but one class no longer needs features from the other. +
  _Drop the unneeded end of the association._
Replace Magic Number with Symbolic Constant::
  You have a literal number with a particular meaning. +
  _Create a constant, name it after the meaning, and replace the number with it._
Encapsulate Collection::
  A method returns a collection. +
  _Make it return a copy of the collection and provide add/remove methods._
Replace Record with Data Class::
  You need to interface with a record structure in a traditional programming environment. +
  _Make a dumb data object for the record._
