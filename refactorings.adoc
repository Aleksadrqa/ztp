## Composing Methods

Extract Method::
  You have a code fragment that can be grouped together. +
  _Turn the fragment into a method whose name explains the purpose of the method._
Inline Method::
  A method's body is just as clear as its name. +
  _Put the method's body into the body of its callers and remove the method._
