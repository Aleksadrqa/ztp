. Define the method in the target class.
. Copy the code from the source method to the target. Adjust the method to make
  it work in its new home.
. Determine how to reference the correct target object from the source.
. Turn the source method into a delegating method.
. Decide whether to remove the source method or retain it as a delegating method.
. If you remove the source method, replace all the references with references
  to the target method.
