Mechanics, from _Refactorings_ by J. Fields et al.

. Check that method is not polymorphic.
. Find all calls to the method.
. Replace each call with the method body.
. Remove the method definition.

## Example

```ruby
def get_rating
  more_than_five_late_deliveries ? 2 : 1
end

def more_than_five_late_deliveries # <1>
  @number_of_late_deliveries > 5
end
```
<1> Inline this method becaues its body is as clear as its name.

.Step 3
```ruby
def get_rating
  @number_of_late_deliveries > 5 ? 2 : 1
end

def more_than_five_late_deliveries # <1>
  @number_of_late_deliveries > 5
end
```

.Step 4
```ruby
def get_rating
  @number_of_late_deliveries > 5 ? 2 : 1
end
```
